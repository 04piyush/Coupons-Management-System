## Coupon System Documentation

### Overview

This coupon system provides a flexible and robust framework for managing various types of discounts for e-commerce applications. The main types of coupons supported are:

- **Cart-Wise**: Discount applied based on the total cart value.
- **Product-Wise**: Discount applied to specific products.
- **Buy X Get Y Free (BxGy)**: Offer free products when specific conditions are met.

### Use Cases

#### Implemented Use Cases

1. **Creating a Coupon**: Ability to create new coupons of type `cart-wise`, `product-wise`, or `bxgy` with associated details such as thresholds, discounts, and product IDs.
2. **Fetching All Coupons**: Retrieve all coupons stored in the system to view current offers.
3. **Fetching a Specific Coupon**: Retrieve a single coupon by its ID to see its specific details.
4. **Updating a Coupon**: Modify the details of an existing coupon by its ID.
5. **Deleting a Coupon**: Remove a coupon from the system by its ID.
6. **Applying a Coupon**: Apply a specific coupon to a cart and calculate the updated cart value after the discount.
7. **Calculating Applicable Coupons for a Cart**: Analyze a given cart and list all coupons that can be applied along with their respective discounts.
8. **Expiration Date Validation**: Coupons can have expiration dates, and the system can check whether a coupon is valid based on the current date.

#### Additional Use Cases (Not Implemented or Challenging)

1. **Usage Limits per Customer**: Implement a system to track and limit the number of times a specific coupon can be used by a single customer.
2. **Stackable Coupons**: Allowing multiple coupons to be applied simultaneously if applicable, and determining the order of their application to maximize the discount.
3. **Exclusion Criteria**: Coupons that exclude certain products, categories, or cart combinations.
4. **Geolocation-Based Coupons**: Applying coupons based on the customer's location or shipping address.
5. **Time-Limited Offers**: Coupons that are only valid during specific hours or days (e.g., flash sales).
6. **New Customer Offers**: Coupons that are only applicable for first-time customers.
7. **Minimum Purchase Quantity for Product-Wise Coupons**: Requiring a minimum quantity of a product to apply a discount.
8. **Maximum Discount Limit**: Setting a cap on the maximum discount that can be given per coupon.
9. **Customer-Specific Coupons**: Coupons that are personalized and can only be used by specific users.
10. **Discount Code Generation**: Automatically generating unique discount codes for specific promotions.
11. **Integration with External Services**: Linking the coupon system with third-party services for tracking, analytics, or additional validation.
12. **Referral Program Integration**: Coupons triggered through referral links or codes.
13. **Customizable Error Messages**: Providing detailed feedback to users when a coupon cannot be applied (e.g., expired, not applicable).

### Assumptions

- **Product Availability**: Assumes all products mentioned in the coupon are available in the cart and that quantities match the required conditions.
- **Correct Data Input**: Assumes input data is correctly formatted and meets the expected schema (e.g., correct product IDs, valid discount percentages).
- **Single Coupon Application**: Only one coupon is considered at a time when applying it to the cart.
- **Expiration Handling**: The system checks coupon validity based on current server time without considering timezone variations.

### Limitations

- **No Multi-Coupon Stacking**: The current implementation does not support applying multiple coupons to a single cart.
- **Lack of User-Specific Logic**: No functionality exists to limit coupons to specific user types (e.g., new vs. returning customers).
- **Limited Validation**: Basic validation is implemented; however, complex business rules (e.g., exclusion criteria) are not enforced.
- **No Real-Time Updates**: Changes to product prices or stock are not reflected dynamically within coupon calculations once the cart is set.
- **Performance Concerns**: The current approach may not be optimized for large datasets or high-traffic environments, as it lacks caching and other performance enhancements.

### Optimizations Considered

- **Database Indexing**: Indexing on coupon types, expiration dates, and frequently queried fields to speed up lookups.
- **Validation Enhancements**: Adding detailed checks to ensure coupons are only applied under the correct conditions.
- **Error Handling**: Enhancing error responses to be more user-friendly and informative.
- **Scalability**: Considered but not implementedâ€”transitioning to microservices architecture if scaling is needed.

### Conclusion

The coupon system provides essential functionality for e-commerce platforms but has room for growth in handling complex use cases, performance optimization, and better user experience. Future improvements could focus on enhancing scalability, usability, and the variety of supported discount scenarios.
